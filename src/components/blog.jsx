        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has revolutionized the way businesses track and manage their assets. This article explores how RFID works, its benefits, and its various use cases in asset tracking and management.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In today's fast-paced business environment, the ability to efficiently track and manage assets is crucial. From inventory management in retail to equipment tracking in healthcare, RFID technology provides a robust solution to ensure assets are accounted for and managed effectively.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">How RFID Works</h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          RFID uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information that can be read from several meters away. Unlike barcodes, which need to be scanned directly, RFID tags can be read without a direct line of sight.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The system consists of three main components: the RFID tag, the RFID reader, and the antenna. The reader sends out a signal via the antenna, which activates the tag and allows the reader to capture the data stored on it. This process happens in real-time, providing up-to-date information about the location and status of an asset.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          There are two types of RFID tags: passive and active. Passive tags do not have a power source and are activated by the electromagnetic field generated by the reader. Active tags, on the other hand, have their own power source and can transmit signals over greater distances.
